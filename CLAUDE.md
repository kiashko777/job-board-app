# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel 10 job board application built with:
- **Backend**: Laravel 10.48.14, PHP 8.1+
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: MySQL with Eloquent ORM
- **Build Tools**: Vite for asset compilation
- **Testing**: PHPUnit for backend tests

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start development server
php artisan serve

# Start Vite for frontend assets
npm run dev

# Build frontend assets for production
npm run build

# Database operations
php artisan migrate                 # Run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed    # Reset database and seed
php artisan db:seed                 # Seed database with test data

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code with Laravel Pint
./vendor/bin/pint

# Run tests
php artisan test
php artisan test --filter TestClassName
php artisan test tests/Unit/SpecificTest.php
```

### Debugging
```bash
# List routes
php artisan route:list

# Interactive shell
php artisan tinker

# Generate IDE helper files (if installed)
php artisan ide-helper:generate
```

## Architecture

### Models & Database Structure
- **Job** (`app/Models/Job.php`): Main job listing model
  - Table: `job_listings`
  - Relations: belongsTo Employer, belongsToMany Tags
  - Key fields: title, salary, employer_id
  
- **Employer** (`app/Models/Employer.php`): Company posting jobs
  - Relations: hasMany Jobs
  
- **Tag** (`app/Models/Tag.php`): Job categorization
  - Many-to-many relationship with Jobs via pivot table
  
- **User** (`app/Models/User.php`): Standard Laravel auth user

### Routing Pattern
Routes defined in `routes/web.php`:
- Simple closure-based routes returning views
- No dedicated controllers yet (all logic in route closures)
- Main routes: `/` (home), `/jobs` (listing), `/jobs/{id}` (detail), `/contact`

### View Structure
- **Layout**: `resources/views/components/layout.blade.php` - Main HTML wrapper
- **Pages**: Individual Blade views in `resources/views/`
- **Components**: Reusable Blade components in `resources/views/components/`
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

### Current Implementation Status
- Basic job listing with pagination
- Job detail pages
- Employer relationship display
- Tag system implemented at model level
- No authentication system implemented yet
- No job creation/editing interface
- No admin panel

## Development Patterns

### Database Conventions
- Use migrations for all schema changes
- Factory pattern for test data generation
- Seeder creates test user and sample jobs

### Model Conventions
- Use Eloquent relationships for data associations
- Mass assignment protection via `$fillable`
- Custom table names specified when not following Laravel conventions

### View Conventions
- Blade component-based architecture
- Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Component slots for flexible content injection

## Testing Approach
- Feature tests in `tests/Feature/`
- Unit tests in `tests/Unit/`
- Use factories for test data generation
- Database refreshed between tests

### AI Team Assignments

| Task | Agent | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Laravel Backend Development** | `laravel-backend-expert` | MUST USE for controllers, services, middleware, routing, authentication |
| **Database & Eloquent Work** | `laravel-eloquent-expert` | MUST USE for models, migrations, relationships, queries, performance tuning |
| **Code Review & Quality** | `code-reviewer` | MUST USE before merging any code to main branch |
| **Performance Optimization** | `performance-optimizer` | MUST USE for slow queries, scaling issues, or cloud cost concerns |
| **Tailwind CSS Styling** | `tailwind-frontend-expert` | MUST USE for UI styling, responsive design, component styling |
| **Frontend Components** | `frontend-developer` | Use for Blade components, JavaScript interactions, form handling |
| **API Design** | `api-architect` | Use when building API endpoints or planning API structure |
| **Documentation** | `documentation-specialist` | Use for README updates, API docs, architecture documentation |

### Usage Examples

**Laravel Backend Tasks:**
```
@laravel-backend-expert Create an authentication system with login/register functionality
@laravel-backend-expert Build job posting CRUD with employer verification
@laravel-eloquent-expert Optimize the job listing query to avoid N+1 problems
```

**Frontend & Styling:**
```
@tailwind-frontend-expert Design a responsive job card component with hover effects
@frontend-developer Add search and filter functionality to the job listings page
```

**Quality & Performance:**
```
@code-reviewer Review the job posting feature before merging
@performance-optimizer Analyze and optimize database queries for job search
```

### Project-Specific Guidelines

1. **Authentication Priority**: No auth system exists yet - high priority for `laravel-backend-expert`
2. **Route Refactoring**: Current closure-based routes should be moved to controllers
3. **Frontend Enhancement**: Blade templates need more interactive components
4. **Database Optimization**: Job search queries need performance tuning for scale
5. **API Development**: Consider building API endpoints for mobile/external access
