# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel 10 job board application built with:
- **Backend**: Laravel 10.48.14, PHP 8.1+
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: MySQL with Eloquent ORM
- **Build Tools**: Vite for asset compilation
- **Testing**: PHPUnit for backend tests

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start development server
php artisan serve

# Start Vite for frontend assets
npm run dev

# Build frontend assets for production
npm run build

# Database operations
php artisan migrate                 # Run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed    # Reset database and seed
php artisan db:seed                 # Seed database with test data

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code with Laravel Pint
./vendor/bin/pint

# Run tests
php artisan test
php artisan test --filter TestClassName
php artisan test tests/Unit/SpecificTest.php
```

### Debugging
```bash
# List routes
php artisan route:list

# Interactive shell
php artisan tinker

# Generate IDE helper files (if installed)
php artisan ide-helper:generate
```

## Architecture

### Models & Database Structure
- **Job** (`app/Models/Job.php`): Main job listing model
  - Table: `job_listings`
  - Relations: belongsTo Employer, belongsToMany Tags
  - Key fields: title, salary, employer_id
  
- **Employer** (`app/Models/Employer.php`): Company posting jobs
  - Relations: hasMany Jobs
  
- **Tag** (`app/Models/Tag.php`): Job categorization
  - Many-to-many relationship with Jobs via pivot table
  
- **User** (`app/Models/User.php`): Standard Laravel auth user

### Routing Pattern
Routes defined in `routes/web.php`:
- Simple closure-based routes returning views
- No dedicated controllers yet (all logic in route closures)
- Main routes: `/` (home), `/jobs` (listing), `/jobs/{id}` (detail), `/contact`

### View Structure
- **Layout**: `resources/views/components/layout.blade.php` - Main HTML wrapper
- **Pages**: Individual Blade views in `resources/views/`
- **Components**: Reusable Blade components in `resources/views/components/`
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

### Current Implementation Status
- Basic job listing with pagination
- Job detail pages
- Employer relationship display
- Tag system implemented at model level
- No authentication system implemented yet
- No job creation/editing interface
- No admin panel

## Development Patterns

### Database Conventions
- Use migrations for all schema changes
- Factory pattern for test data generation
- Seeder creates test user and sample jobs

### Model Conventions
- Use Eloquent relationships for data associations
- Mass assignment protection via `$fillable`
- Custom table names specified when not following Laravel conventions

### View Conventions
- Blade component-based architecture
- Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Component slots for flexible content injection

## Testing Approach
- Feature tests in `tests/Feature/`
- Unit tests in `tests/Unit/`
- Use factories for test data generation
- Database refreshed between tests
